## Description

Coinscale is a cryptocurrency trading simulator which lets users assemble their dream portfolio and track its performance through time. Registered users receive an initial $20,000 in play money and can travel back and forth in time, placing buy and sell orders in a simulated trading environment which mirrors the development of the actual cryptocurrency markets. The application dashboard provides detailed data on the performance of individual cryptocurrencies and aggregate data for the user's portfolio, as well as an overview of trade transactions.

A deployed version of Coinscale can be found at [https://coinscale.netlify.com/](https://coinscale.netlify.com/). For documentation of the server-side code and API, please see [this repository](https://github.com/thomahau/coinscale-api). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
